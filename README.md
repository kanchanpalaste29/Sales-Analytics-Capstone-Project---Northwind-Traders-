# Sales Analytics Capstone Project – Northwind Traders

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to transform the Northwind Traders dataset into an interactive analytics dashboard. It presents key business insights through structured analysis and intuitive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview
The Sales Analytics Capstone Project is designed to analyze the end-to-end operations of Northwind Traders, a wholesale food distribution company. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of revenue trends, customer purchasing patterns, product and inventory status, supplier and logistics efficiency, and employee performance. 

A MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) business framework is applied to ensure that all analytical areas are clearly defined, non-overlapping, and collectively cover the entire business. Interactive filters, drill-downs, and KPI indicators enable stakeholders to explore data dynamically and identify actionable insights that support strategic and operational decisions.
